Low-level developer.  
Tool builder.  
System breaker (in controlled environments).  

2+ years deep in native code, memory-level concepts, and performance-focused development.

I don’t build basic apps.  
I build things that sit closer to the metal.

## 🧠 What I Do

• Custom desktop software  
• Experimental game tooling  
• Automation systems  
• Windows-based utilities  
• Reverse engineering research  
• Performance optimization  

I like understanding how things *actually* work under the hood —  
not just using high-level wrappers.

## 🏗 Development Style

- Performance > Bloat  
- Clean logic > Overengineering  
- Minimal UI, maximum function

If it can be optimized, rewritten cleaner, or built better —  
I’m doing it.
